Q1) How would you deploy this application in production?
A1) First I would set up a production environment in virtual machine, cloud instance, or Kubernetes cluster to deploy these ETL processes and Postgres database. Then, I would use the configured Docker Compose file or a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes to deploy your ETL processes and Postgres database into production. After that with the help of firewalls, VPNs, or SSL/TLS I would focus on configuring network security to prevent unauthorized access. In the end I will make sure that the ETL processes are running smoothly by monitoring and logging.

Q2) What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?
A2) Adding automated testing components like pytest and unittest can help catch bugs early, and also this will help us to find the exact pain point in the ETL process. Also, I would add CI/CD pipeline tools like GitLab, Jenkins to automate the process of devloping, interating and deploying
