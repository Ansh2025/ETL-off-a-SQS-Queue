First I would set up a production environment in virtual machine, cloud instance, or Kubernetes cluster to deploy these ETL processes and Postgres database. Then, I would use the configured Docker Compose file or a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes to deploy your ETL processes and Postgres database into production. After that with the help of firewalls, VPNs, or SSL/TLS I would focus on configuring network security to prevent unauthorized access. In the end I will make sure that the ETL processes are running smoothly by monitoring and logging.
